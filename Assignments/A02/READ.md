# Software Tool:

http://html-online.com/

# Why I picked it:

This is a very simple to use online html editor. I chose it because I use it daily for work and I wanted to choose a software tool that I actually use. I work in the Admissions office underneath the Assistant Director of Admissions and many times I am required to build emails using html. 

The site we use has its own editor for creating emails but I like that the html online site places the markup and the email side by side. Even though I typically don't need to edit the markup, I like to play with html behind the email in order to improve the display of the email.

No, the site the school uses does not include css so I cannot do much styling.
